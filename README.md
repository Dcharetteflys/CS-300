# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
This project includes assignments, milestones, and projects that helped us learn about different data structures like vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and binary search trees. By working through these tasks, we got a better idea of how each structure works and when to use them. We also used pseudocode to look at time and space complexity and compare how well each data structure performs.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
When I analyzed runtime complexity, I found that sorting with a vector would be the quickest. Still, I chose to use a binary search tree because an inOrder traversal can neatly print the data in alphanumeric order with little extra effort. Understanding data structures is important because our world runs on data, and how we store and access that data really matters.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
To overcome roadblocks that I ran into when perform my assignemnts I reveiwed the learnign material and 
found the answers that to previous assignments which was a great help. These showed me examples on how things were supposed to be written and used these as refereance to my own code to help guide me.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
 I determined that I still have a lot to learn about even some of the simplest tasks and that code design can have implications on how fast a program runs.
